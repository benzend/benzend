### Overview

JavaScript has been my main programming language since the beginning of my web development journey. However I've come to use many other tools as lots of engineers do. 

Frontend-wise, I've built things with React, Vue, Svelte and AngularJS. I've also played with some JQuery as well. 

On the backend side, I've used Node for most of my initial backend experience. However I'm currently working with Ruby and am taking on Rust in my own freetime. 

Speaking of Rust, I'm currently diving into it, as the challenge and benefits of learning it has inspired me to.

## Some things to know about me ðŸ¤“

- I have a knack for studying foreign languages, which currently include Japanese, German and Spanish. I hope to keep growing this list in the future.
- Hiking and outdoorsy things have been one of the best stress relievers I've come across so I do it as much as I can.
- I'm on a constant search for bringing up and creating value.
