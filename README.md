# You Have Encountered A Wild Benjamin Scott!

A self taught software engineer in the pursuit of the creation of useful and exciting things.

## Tech favorites ðŸ› 

- TypeScript
- React
- Nestjs
- Rust

### Overview

React has been my main library since the beginning of my web development journey. However I've come to use many others as many developers do. 

Frontend-wise, I've built things with Vue, AngularJS and vanilla JS (yes jQuery too). 

On the backend side, I've managed to use Node for most of my backend experience. However I'm currently working with Ruby and am taking on Rust in my own freetime. 

Speaking of Rust, I'm currently diving into it, as the challenge and benefits of learning it has inspired me. 

## Some things to know about me ðŸ¤“

- I have a knack for studying foreign languages, which currently include Japanese, German and Spanish. I hope to keep growing this list in the future.
- Hiking and outdoorsy things have been one of the best stress relievers I've come across so I do it as much as I can.
- I'm on a constant search for bringing up and creating value.
