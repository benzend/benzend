# You have encountered a wild Benjamin Scott!

A self taught software engineer in the pursuit of the creation of useful and exciting things.

## Tech favorites ðŸ› 

- TypeScript
- React
- Nestjs
- GoLang

### Overview

Out of my favorites, I've used React the most out of the four. However I've touched on Vue, Angular and Svelte in order to get my feet wet.

When it comes to backend languages, node.js and express have been there for me for most of my backend experience, however I've really come to like Nestjs and its TypeScript support. Haven't built anything too big with it yet, however I do plan on doing more with it. 

GoLang is a new land for me. It's something that I've come to really find interesting with its outstanding multithreading support, binary compiler and other sweet features.  

## Some things to know about me ðŸ¤“

- I have a knack for studying foreign languages, which currently include Japanese, German and Spanish. I hope to grow this list in the future!
- Hiking and outdoorsy things have been one of the best stress relievers I've come across. Getting "out there" is really something that comes in handy.
- I'm on a constant search for bringing and creating value. I hope to help people however I can!
