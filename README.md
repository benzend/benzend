## Overview

JavaScript has been my main programming language since the beginning of my web development journey. However I've come to use many other tools as lots of engineers do. 

Frontend-wise, I've built things with React, Nextjs, Vue, Svelte and AngularJS. I've also played with some JQuery as well. 

On the backend side, I've used Node for most of my initial backend experience. However I'm currently working with Ruby on Rails and Django and am taking on Rust in my own freetime.

## Some things to know about me ðŸ¤“

- As a learner, I have a knack for studying foreign languages which include Japanese, German and Spanish.
- As a creative, I love to write, read non-fiction, draw from time to time and build anything and everything.
- As an innovator, I'm on a constant search for bringing up and creating value wherever I am able to.
