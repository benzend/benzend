# You have encountered a wild Benjamin Scott!

As a self taught software engineer in the pursuit of the creation of useful and exciting things, this is where you can find my public work.

## Tech favorites ðŸ› 

I've come to truly enjoy JavaScript and it's bffs TypeScript and React. They are my bread and butter.

Python has been a friend for some time as well, building out plugins for 3D printers has been a blast!

I'm currently working on my GoLang, a fantastic language. However, I'm currently wondering if I should check out Rust ðŸ¤”

## Some things to know about me ðŸ¤“

- I have a knack for studying foreign languages, which currently include Japanese, German and Spanish. I hope to grow this list in the future!
- Hiking and outdoorsy things have been one of the best stress relievers I've come across. Getting "out there" is really something that comes in handy.
- I'm on a constant search for bringing and creating value. I hope to help people however I can!
